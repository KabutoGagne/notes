## code
Day by day,in a land of bytes and bits, 
Where bugs are just a twist, 
I sit with my keyboard,Coding like a wizard,  
never bored.I type, I debug, I push, I pull,With every commit,  
I feel so full,Of joy and laughter, and sometimes stress, 
But coding's my passion, and I can't guess.I dream in code,  
in loops and arrays,Building castles with my digital ways, 
So here's to the bugs, and the late-night glow,Of screens and keyboards,  
let the magic flow!
